Multi-Layer Shallow Water Examples - 1D

This directory contains a number of examples for solving the two layer shallow
water equations in one dimension using PyClaw.  If you have a valid install of 
PyClaw you should be able to run the examples from this directory with some
tweaks such as where you want the output and plots to go (set the DATA_PATH
environment variable).

Note that many of these scripts were set up to make nice movies and output 
much more often than is probably necessary.  In fact the output takes up a
significant ammount of the wall clock time (as does the plotting).

Examples
========
 - Simple Waves (wave_family.py):  Test which uses a pertubation on a steady
   state in only one wave family.  Also includes a jump in bathymetry at 
   x = 0.5 which causes the bottom layer to become dry.
 - Oscillatory Wind in a Bath Tub (oscillatory.py):  Test demonstrating loss
   of hyperbolicity.  Starts with the water at rest and a wind field applied
   over the course of the simulation.  The boundaries are implemented as wall
   boundaries in multilayer/bc.py.
 - Oceanic Shelf (shelf.py):  Tests involving oceanic scale flows with a shelf
   represented with either a jump discontinuity or sloping transition.  The
   initial condition is a small hump of water away from the shelf.  The file
   shelf_contour.py plots contours of the entire simulation.
 - All Rarefaction Test (rarefaction.py):  Example intialized with an all
   rarefaction solution as the expected Riemann solution.
 - Dry State Tests (dry_state.py):  Example of the entropy violating
   rarefaction case.
