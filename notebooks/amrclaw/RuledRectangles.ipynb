    "In past versions of AMRClaw and GeoClaw one could specify \"refinement regions\" as rectangles over which a `minlevel` and `maxlevel` are specified (perhaps over some time interval), as described at <http://www.clawpack.org/regions.html>.\n",
    "\n",
    "Allowing only rectangles made it very easy to check each cell for inclusion in a region, but is a severe restriction --  often a number of rectangles must be used to follow a complicated coastline, for example, or else many points ended up being refined that did not require it (e.g. onshore points that never get wet in a GeoClaw simulation).\n",
    "\n",
    "Starting in Version 5.7.0, we have introduced a new data structure called a \"Ruled Rectangle\" that is a special type of polygon for which it is also easy to check whether a given point is inside or outside, but that is much more flexible than a rectangle.  It is a special case of a \"ruled surface\", which is a surface in 3D that is bounded by two curves, each parameterized by $s$ from $s_1$ to $s_2$, and with the surface defined as the union of all the line segments connecting one curve to the other for each value of $s$ in $[s_1,s_2]$.  A Ruled Rectangle is a special case in which each curve lies in the $x$-$y$ plane and either $s=x$ for some range of $x$ values or $s=y$ for some range of $y$ values.  If $s=x$, for example, then the line segments defining the surface are intervals $y_{\\scriptstyle lower}(x) \\leq y \\leq y_{\\scriptstyle upper}(x)$ for each $x$ over some range $x_1 \\leq x \\leq x_2$.  It is easy to check if a given $(x_c,y_c)$ is in this region:  it is if $x_1 \\leq x_c \\leq x_2$ and in addition $y_{\\scriptstyle lower}(x_c) \\leq y_c \\leq y_{\\scriptstyle upper}(x_c)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The class `region_tools.RuledRectangle` supports a subset of ruled rectangles defined by a finite set of $s$ values along a coordinate line, e.g. $s[0] < s[1] < s[2] < \\cdots < s[N]$ and for each $s[k]$ two values `lower[k]` and `upper[k]`.  If `rr` is an instance of this class then `rr.s`, `rr.lower`, and `rr.upper` contain these arrays.  Whether `s` corresponds to `x` or `y` is determined by:\n",
    "\n",
    " - If `rr.ixy in [1, 'x']` then `s` gives a set of $x$ values,\n",
    " - If `rr.ixy in [2, 'y']` then `s` gives a set of $y$ values.  \n",
    " \n",
    "The points specified can then be connected by line segments to define a Ruled Rectangle, and this is done if `rr.method == 1` (piecewise linear).  On the other hand, if `rr.method == 0` (piecewise constant) then the values `lower[k], upper[k]` are used as the bounds for all `s` in the interval $s[k] \\leq s \\leq s[k+1]$ (for $k = 0,~1,~\\ldots,~N-1$).  In this case the values `lower[N], upper[N]` are not used.  This also defines a polygon, but one that consists of a set of *stacked boxes*.  The advantage of the latter form is that it is slightly easier to check if a point is in the Ruled Rectangle since no linear interpolation is required along the edges.  Also for some applications we want the Ruled Rectangle to exactly cover a contiguous set of finite volume grid cells, which has the shape of a set of stacked boxes."

Conversely, *any* convex polygon can be expressed as a Ruled Rectangle --- simply order the vertices so that the $x$ values are increasing, for example, and use these as the `s` values in a `RuledRectangle` with `ixy='x'`.  Then for each $x$ there is a connected interval of $y$ values that lie within the polygon (by convexity), so this defines the `lower` and `upper` values. (Or you could start by ordering vertices by increasing $y$ values and similarly define a `RuledRectangle` with `ixy='y'`.)\n",

    "The figure below shows a Ruled Rectangle that roughly covers the continental shelf offshore of Vancouver Island and Washington state.   The region may need to be refined to a higher level than the deeper ocean in order to capture shoaling tsunami waves interacting with the shelf topography.  This region was defined by first selecting a set of points from etopo1 topography satisfying certain constraints on elevation using the marching front algorithm described in [MarchingFront.ipynb](MarchingFront.ipynb), and then using the `region_tools.ruledrectangle_covering_selected_points` function to build a Ruled Rectangle covering these points.  For the complete code see [MakeFlagregionsCoast.ipynb](MakeFlagregionsCoast.ipynb)."
