    "The module [clawpack.geoclaw.marching_front.py](https://github.com/clawpack/geoclaw/blob/master/src/python/geoclaw/marching_front.py) defines a function `select_by_flooding` that takes as input an array `Ztopo` containing topography elevations on a rectangular grid and returns an array `pt_chosen` of the same shape with values 1 (if chosen) or 0 (if not chosen).  Other inputs specify the criteria used to choose points, as described below.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic idea is that chosen points satisfy certain elevation requirements along with connectivity to the coast.  This was originally developed to identify points in a topography DEM where the topography value $Z$ is below MHW, but that should be initialized as dry land because they are in regions protected by dikes or levies.  In this situation, the marching algorithm is used by initializing points well offshore (e.g. with $Z < -5$ meters) as *wet* and other points to *unset*.  Then the front between *wet/unset* points is advanced by marking neighboring points as *dry* if $Z\\geq0$ or as *wet* if $Z<0$. This is repeated iteratively for each new front until there are no more *wet* points with *unset* neighbors.  At this point any points still *unset* are entirely buffered by *dry* points and must lie behind dikes, so these are also set to *dry*.  See the notebook [MarchingFront.ipynb](MarchingFront.ipynb) for more about this application.\n",

    "## Function arguments\n",
    "\n",
    "The main function in the `marching_front.py` module is `select_by_flooding`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The function is defined by:\n",
    "```\n",
    "def select_by_flooding(Ztopo, mask=None, prev_pts_chosen=None,\n",
    "                       Z1=-5., Z2=0., max_iters=None, verbose=False):\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If `Z1 <= Z2` then points where `Ztopo <= Z1` are first selected and \n",
    "then a marching algorithm is used to select neighboring points that \n",
    "satisfy `Ztopo <= Z2`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Think of chosen points as \"wet\" and unchosen points as \"dry\" \n",
    "and new points are flooded if at least one neighbor is \"wet\" and \n",
    "the topography is low enough. Starting from deep water (e.g. `Z1 = -5`)\n",
    "this allows flooding up to MHW (`Z2 = 0`) without going past dikes that\n",
    "protect dry land with lower elevation.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, this can also be called with `Z1 > Z2`, in which case points\n",
    "where `Ztopo >= Z1` are first selected and then the marching algorithm is \n",
    "used to select neighboring points that satisfy `Ztopo >= Z2`.\n",
    "This is useful to select offshore points where the water is shallow,\n",
    "(and that are connected to the shore by a path of shallow points) \n",
    "e.g. to identify points on the continental shelf to set up a \n",
    "flag region for refinement.\n",
    "\n",
    "If `max_iters=None` then iterate to convergence.\n",
    "Otherwise, at most `max_iters` iterations are taken, so setting\n",
    "this to a small value only selects points within this many grid\n",
    "points of where `Ztopo <= Z1`, useful for buffering or selecting a few\n",
    "onshore points along the coast regardless of elevation.\n",
    "\n",
    "If `prev_pts_chosen` is None we are starting from scratch, otherwise\n",
    "we possibly add additional chosen points to an existing array.\n",
    "Points where `prev_pts_chosen[i,j]==1` won't change but those `==0` may be\n",
    "changed to 1 based on the new criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "If `mask==None` or `mask==False` then the entire array is subject to \n",
    "selection.  If `mask` is an array with `mask[i,j]==True` at some points,\n",
    "then either:\n",
    "- these masked points are marked as not selected (`pts_chosen[i,j]=0`)\n",
    "  if `prev_pts_chosen==None`, or\n",
    "- these masked points are not touched if `prev_pts_chosen` is an\n",

This is done by defining a `geoclaw.topotools.Topography` object and setting its `Z` attribute based on `pt_chosen`, and then writing this as a topofile with `topo_type==3`.  Then in `setrun.py` this file can be specified as a mask that is read in and used when initializing grid cells.
