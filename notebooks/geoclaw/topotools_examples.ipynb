In order to do this, there is a method in the `Topography` class called `interp_unstructured` which has a number of options.  Here we will just go with the defaults (please see the documentation for the full assortment of options).   In this case we will provide two things to the routine.  The first is topography to use to fill in possible gaps in the unstructured topography.  This \"fill topography\" can be structured or unstructured.  The second argument we provide is a limit on the calculated grid spacing.  The routine attempts to calculate the minimum distance between two points and uses this as the basis of the structured grid.  Placing a limit on this insures that the resulting grid is not too fine.  Addtional options for filtering the data in the routine, smoothing and interpolation strategies are also available."
