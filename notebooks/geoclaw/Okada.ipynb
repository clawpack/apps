    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"Okada model\" takes as input the slip on a rectangular patch of a fault deep in the earth and produces the resulting deformation of the earth's surface.  For tsunami modeling, we are particularly interested in the vertical motion of the seafloor above the fault. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Okada model makes many assumptions that only approximate reality, in particular:\n",
    " - The earth is modeled as a perfectly elastic half space.  The slip is uniform on a rectangular patch and a Greens' function solution to the half space problem is integrated to obtain the vertical deformation at the surface of the half plane.  The seafloor topography is ignored in computing the Okada deformation (which is then generally added to the real topography to get the modified topography during the earthquake).\n",
    " - The half space is assumed to be isotropic with uniform elastic moduli.  The Poisson ratio is generally taken to be 0.25 and the shear modulus (or rigidity) is constant, often taken to be $4\\times 10^{11}$ dyne/cm$^2 = 40$ GPa.\n",
    " \n",
    "Complex earthquake fault surfaces are generally approximated by a subdividing into a set of rectangular subfaults, each of which might have different orientation and slip properties.  The Okada model is applied to each and then the resulting surface deformations are summed.  The Okada model is linear, so that if a single planar fault is split into subfaults the resulting surface deformation should be independent of the number of pieces its split into.\n",
    "\n",
    "The GeoClaw *dtopotools.Fault* class provides tools for specifying a fault as a collection of *dtopotools.SubFault* objects, and an object of this class has a method *create_dtopography* that applies the Okada model and returns a *dtopotools.DTopography* object expressing the surface deformation.  In this notebook we illustrate the Okada model by working with a fault that consists of a single subfault.\n",
    "\n",
    "A subfault is specified via the following standard parameters:\n",
    " - *length* and *width* of the fault plane (specified in meters below),\n",
    " - *latitude* and *longitude* of some point on the fault plane, typically\n",
    "      either the centroid or the center of the top (shallowest edge),\n",
    " - *depth* of the specified point below the sea floor (in meters below),\n",
    " - *strike*, the orientation of the top edge, measured in degrees\n",
    "      clockwise from North, between 0 and 360.  The fault plane dips downward\n",
    "      to the right when moving along the top edge in the strike direction.\n",
    " - *dip*, angle at which the plane dips downward from the top edge, a\n",
    "      positive angle between 0 and 90 degrees.\n",
    " - *rake*, the angle in the fault plane in which the slip occurs,\n",
    "      measured in degrees counterclockwise from the strike direction.\n",
    "      Between -180 and 180.\n",
    " - *slip > 0*, the distance (measured in meters below) the hanging-wall block moves\n",
    "      relative to the footwall block, in the direction specified by the rake.\n",
    "      The \"hanging-wall block\" is the one above the dipping fault plane (or to the\n",
    "      right if you move along the fault in the strike direction).\n",
    "      \n",
    "\n",

The *dip* is 10 degrees and the fault extends from a depth of 5 km at the up-dip edge to about 14 km at the downdip edge.  Note that above the width of the subfault is set to 50 km and that the \"Fault planes\" plot axes are in degrees.  This fault is located at the equator where 1 degree is approximate 111 km in both directions.\n",
