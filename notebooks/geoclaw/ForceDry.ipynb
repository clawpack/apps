    "The [MarchingFront.ipynb](MarchingFront.ipynb) notebook illustrated tools to select points from a topography DEM that satisfy given constraints on elevation, and how this can be used to determine dry land behind dikes.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we explore this more and show how to define an array that can be read into GeoClaw and used when initializing the water depth during the creation of new grid patches. \n",
    "\n",
    "See also the documentation page [Force Cells to be Dry Initially](http://www.clawpack.org/force_dry.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "We define an rectangular array `force_dry_init` that is aligned with cell centers of the computational grid at some resolution (typically the finest resolution) and that has the value `force_dry_init[i,j] = 1` to indicate cells that should be initialized to dry (`h[i,j] = 0`) regardless of the value of the GeoClaw topography `B[i,j]` in this cell.   If `force_dry_init[i,j] = 0` the the cell is initialized in the usual manner, which generally means \n",
    "\n",
    "`h[i,j] = max(0, sea_level - B[i,j])`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Another new feature allows initializing the depth so that the surface elevation `eta` is spatially varying rather than using a single scalar value `sea_level` everywhere.  That feature is described in [VariableEtaInit.ipynb](VariableEtaInit.ipynb).  If used in conjunction with a `force_dry_init` array, `force_dry_init[i,j] = 1` still indicates that the cell should be dry while elsewhere the \"usual\" thing is done.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In the project archived at [IslandWhidbeyTHA_2019 project webpage](http://depts.washington.edu/ptha/IslandSkagitTHA_2019/), rather than a `force_dry_init` array, the masking array was called `allow_wet_init` with the meaning of 0 and 1 reversed. However, it seems more sensible to have the default be the \"usual\" initialization since the  `force_dry_init` array may only cover a subset of the computational domain where the special initialization is required.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The current implementation allows only one `force_dry_init` array but ideally this would be generalized to allow multiple arrays covering different subsets of the domain, and maybe at different grid resolutions?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Typically the `force_dry_init` array is computed from a DEM file at the desired resolution, using the marching front algorithm defined in [MarchingFront.ipynb](MarchingFront.ipynb). But recall that the GeoClaw topography value `B[i,j]` does not agree with the DEM value `Z[i,j]` even if the cell center is aligned with the DEM point due to the way `B` is computed by averaging over piecewise bilinear functions that interpolate the `Z` values.  So one has to be careful not to set `force_dry_init[i,j] = 1` in a cell close to the shore simply because `Z > 0` at this point since the `B` value might be negative in the cell.  This is dealt with in the examples below by doing some buffering."
