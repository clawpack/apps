    "This example starts with a `setrun.py` file similar to what resulted after working through the `$CLAW/apps/notebooks/geoclaw/chile2010a` example, with a couple changes:\n",
    "\n",
    " - The Level 3 grids are now refined by a factor of 6 relative to Level 2.\n",
    " - A gauge has been added at the location of [DART buoy 32412](http://www.ndbc.noaa.gov/station_page.php?station=32412).   DART (Deep Ocean Assessment and Reporting of Tsunamis) buoys transmit data from pressure gauges on the sea floor that can measure the water pressure accurately enough to detect long wave disturbances in the water surface level.  Data from this site has been de-tided and also saved in this directory, in the file `32412_notide.txt`.\n",
    " \n",
    "In this example we will first run the code as it is set up to view the gauge results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we will replace this with a gauge off the coast of Peru to better observe edge waves that are trapped on the continental shelf in this region.  We will also see a different way to specify output times for the animation, and how to work with gauge data in Python.\n",

    "Note that the way gauges work in GeoClaw is to output the elevation at this gauge (also momenta) at each time step, interpolating to each gauge location from the finest AMR grid available at this time in this region.  In this example we started recording at this gauge at time 3.5 hours, when there was already a Level 3 grid in this region.  If we had started recording earlier, this gauge might have been in a cell that was dry on a coarser grid (since it is so close to the coast) in which case the elevation of the land (possibly 10s or 100s of meters) would have been recorded at earlier times.  If you see big jump discontinuities in gauge plots, this is probably what is happening.  You can adjust the  time over which plotting is done in `setplot.py`."
