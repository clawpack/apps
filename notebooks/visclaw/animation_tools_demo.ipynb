    "This notebook demonstrates the tools in the `clawpack.visclaw.animation_tools` module (new in Version 5.4.0 and substantially updated in v5.7.0), which facilitates creating a list of figures or images and viewing them as an animation.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Several approaches are supported:\n",
    "\n",
    " - Using the `ipywidgets.interact` allows generating an interactive widget for sweeping through the frames.  This may be easiest to work with when running a notebook interactively, including when using <http://mybinder.org>.\n",
    " \n",
    " - Creating an animation as javascript in the notebook.  This can now be done directly using the `to_jshtml` method defined for an animation created using [matplotlib.animation](https://matplotlib.org/3.1.1/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.animation.Animation.html). \n",
    "   *Historical note:* this approach was first pioneered in Clawpack and developed further by Jake Vanderplas in his [JSAnimation](https://github.com/jakevdp/JSAnimation) package, later incorporated into matplotlib.\n",
    "\n",
    " - Alternatively the `to_html5_video` method can be used to create an mp4 video.\n",
    "\n",
    " - The `to_jshtml` versions can also be embedded in another webpage or in Sphinx documentation, using the `animation_tools.make_html` and `animation_tools.make_rst` functions.\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Converting frames in a Clawpack `_plots` directory to animations:\n",
    " \n",
    " The `animation_tools.make_anim_outputs_from_plotdir` function can be used to turn the png files in a Clawpack `_plots` directory into stand-alone `.html`, `.mp4`, or `.rst` files.\n",
    " \n",
