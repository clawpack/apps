Radial bowl test case for fgmax routines  
========================================


Illustrates how to set up a grid of points to monitor the maximum amplitude of
the wave at each point on a grid of points, a transect, and a curve along
the shoreline.

This uses the "fgmax" (fixed grid maxima monitoring)
capabilities described in http://www.clawpack.org/fgmax.html.


To test::

    python make_fgmax.py   # to create fgmax_grid.txt
    make .output
    python plot_fgmax.py   # to plot fgmax results
    make plots

Or simply::

    make all

In addition to the usual time frame plots in
`_plots <./_plots/_PlotIndex.html>`_, this should produce 

- `_plots/fgmax_grid1.png <./_plots/fgmax_grid1.png>`_, 
  maximum depth on an fgmax grid
  near the shoreline (black curve) along the x-axis.
- `_plots/fgmax_grid2.png <./_plots/fgmax_grid2.png>`_, 
  maximum depth on an fgmax grid
  near the shoreline (black curve) along the diagonal.
- `_plots/fgmax_transects.png <./_plots/fgmax_transects.png>`_, 
  maximum surface elevation on a transect orthogonal to shoreline.  
  Two transects are shown, one at the x-axis and the other along the diagonal.

- `_plots/fgmax_along_shore.png <./_plots/fgmax_along_shore.png>`_, 
  maximum surface elevation = depth at the shoreline (located at radius
  r = 90 meters) as a function of theta.  The max values are only monitored
  on refinement level 3, which is only allowed near the x-axis and the
  diagonal, so intermediate values of theta show no results.  

  Due to radial symmetry the maximum depth should be independent of theta,
  and this plot should show that the value is around :math:`1.95~\pm~0.03`
  meters.


*Note:*

- This example is based on `$CLAW/geoclaw/examples/tsunami/bowl-radial` but
  with some changes to parameters and the topography is adjusted so the 
  shoreline is at radius 90 meters.

- See http://www.clawpack.org/fgmax.html for more information about
  specifying fgmax parameters.

- The file `make_fgmax.py` is no longer present in this directory.
  Instead all the fgmax grids are set up directly in `setrun.py`.

  Inspect `setrun.py` for an example of how to specify a rectangular
  grid (grid1), a quadrilateral grid (grid2), a transect, or an arbitrary
  set of points (in this case a circular arc along the shoreline).


- The file `plot_fgmax.py` is used to plot the fgmax results. Also the file
  `setplot.py` includes the lines::

        #-----------------------------------------
        # Figures for fgmax - max values on fixed grids
        #-----------------------------------------
        otherfigure = plotdata.new_otherfigure(name='max amplitude on grid 1', 
                        fname='fgmax_grid1.png')
        otherfigure = plotdata.new_otherfigure(name='max amplitude on grid 2', 
                        fname='fgmax_grid2.png')
        otherfigure = plotdata.new_otherfigure(name='max amplitude on transects', 
                        fname='fgmax_transects.png')
        otherfigure = plotdata.new_otherfigure(name='max amplitude along shore', 
                        fname='fgmax_along_shore.png')


  This results in the link found on `_plots/_PlotIndex.html`.
