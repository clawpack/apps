Radial dam-break problem for 2D shallow water equations
--------------------------------------------------------

Example [book/chap21/radialdam/1drad] to accompany the book
`Finite Volume Methods for Hyperbolic Problems
<http://www.clawpack.org/book.html>`_
by R. J. LeVeque.

Converted to Clawpack 5.0 form in 2016.

The code in this directory solves the 1d shallow water equations with a
geometric source term for the radial symmetry.  It is used to create a
reference solution for comparison to the 2d solution.
