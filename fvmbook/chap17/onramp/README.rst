Traffic Flow equation with an on ramp source
------------------------------------------

Traffic flow equations with a delta function source term representing
an on ramp at x=0.  This is implemented using the fractional step approach
in src1.f
    
Example [book/chap17/onramp] to accompany the book 
`Finite Volume Methods for Hyperbolic Problems <http://www.clawpack.org/book>`_
