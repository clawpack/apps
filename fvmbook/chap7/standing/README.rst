Acoustics with a standing wave
------------------------------------------

Acoustics equations with standing-wave data, 
solid walls at :math:`x=0,~ x=1`, as specified in `setrun.py`.
    
Example [book/chap7/standing] to accompany the book 
`Finite Volume Methods for Hyperbolic Problems
<http://www.clawpack.org/book.html>`_
by R. J. LeVeque.

Note that `cfl_desired` is set to 1 in `setrun.py`, and in this case even
the first order Godunov method is "exact".
