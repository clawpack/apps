Notes on converting a 4.x version to 5.0...

Copy files from $CLAW/clawpack-4.x/book/...  
  to corresponding directory in $CLAW/apps/fvmbook

python $CLAW/clawutil/src/python/clawutil/conversion/convert46to50.py

Fix Makefile based on what's in Makefile_4.x:
  do not need driver.f
  change to use Riemann solver from $(CLAW)/riemann/src/
  for any local files, remove pointers to library version

Fix setrun.py based on setrun.py_4.x:
  if probdata is set, these lines must be copied over.

Check all *.f files to make sure indices were properly reordered.

Also need to modify calling sequences and declaration statements in qinit.f (and setaux.f, b4stepN.f, perhaps other routines in the directory) to remove maxmx, etc.

Check if aux(*,...) appears in declaration, if so change to aux(maux,...)

Check if there are tab characters in .f file and if so expand to spaces

Copy $CLAW/apps/fvmbook/README_template.rst  new_directory/README.rst
Modify this file based on what's in README.txt
